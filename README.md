# laddergram

The  goal  of  a  ladder-gram  is  to  transform  a  source  word  into  the  target  word  in  the  least 
number of steps. During each step, you must replace one letter in the previous word so that 
a  new  word  is  formed,  but  without  changing the  positions  of  the  other  letters.  All  words 
must  exist  in  the  supplied  dictionary(dictionary.txt).  For  example,  we  can  achieve the 
alchemist's dream of changing “lead” to “gold”in  3  steps(lead->load->goad->gold),  or 
“hide” to “seek”in 6steps(hide->side->site->sits->sies->sees->seek).

You have been supplied with a Python program (word_ladder.py) for this problem that was 
written  by  an  obviously  brilliant  Python  programmer  who  unfortunately  did  not  believe  in 
documentation  nor  that  users  would  make  any  mistakes.  Even  worse,  this  code  has  been 
modified by a somewhat less talented programmer and it no longer works as efficiently as it used to.
