*DOCS*
[INCOMPLETE] Produce a software design document based on the sample template for this program. In particular you must document each function within the program stating clearly what theydo and how theydo it. 

*PROGRAM*
[COMPLETE] All possible user input errors are handled correctly.

[COMPLETE] The program performs as it did before the less talented programmer got his hands  on  it.  In  particular  it  must  go  from “lead” to “gold” in 3 steps and “hide” to “seek”in 6 steps.

*TESTING*
[INCOMPLETE] You must use the Python unittest module to test the functions of your program and provide  testcasesfor  each  function.  Note  that  to  facilitate  the  testing,  you  can rewrite the code to make it testable.

*EXTRA*
[INCOMPLETE] The user can supply a list of words that are not 
	     allowed to be used within the steps from a start word to a target word.

[COMPLETE] The  user  has  the  option  of supplying  a  word  
	     that  must  exist on  the  path  to the  target  word.  
	     (HINT:split  this  into  2 paths,  making  sure  the  target  
             word doesn’t appear on the first path to the intermediary word)
